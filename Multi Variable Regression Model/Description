Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to create a data-driven blueprint for launching a successful new restaurant in the U.S.. Instead of relying on guesswork, the project used statistical analysis of a large Yelp dataset (reviews, restaurant profiles, and user data) to answer fundamental strategic questions for a new restaurant owner : 
Where is the most promising market to open? 
What type of restaurant concept and cuisine is most likely to succeed? 
Which facilities and services are essential for earning high ratings? 
Why do some restaurants get 5-star reviews while others struggle? 
How can a strong online reputation be built?
